 Welcome to 'Prose Parlor', a book website project crafted with JavaScript by a passionate beginner in the field. As I embark on my journey to pursue a career in web development, 
this project serves as a hands-on learning experience to hone my skills in JavaScript and web development. While the site is a work in progress, with features such as bookmarks, user panels,
and homepage design currently under development, it reflects my dedication to continuous improvement and growth in the realm of JavaScript development.
